# RESTORECORD DISCORD (fucker)
Using this program, you can link your accounts using their **Tokens** to the **RestoreCord application**.
**RestoreCord** is an application that is used to easily transfer users from **server** to **server**. Most commonly used to prevent the loss of users.

# This program may not work, due to the fact that it is one of my older projects.
idk, test it.

# Tutorial (how to use):
```
1. Set the configuration file (config.json), if you want to use Proxy set "proxies" to true, if not then set it to false.
2. Insert your Discord Account Authorization Tokens into the data/tokens.txt file so that it looks like Token -> New Line -> Token ...
3. Run main.py
4. Paste your link to Discord Application (pls don't paste restorecord link)
```
